<p>
Hello! I'm Lee Yohan. I'm a university student majoring in Computer Science.
</p>

<p>
I currently reside in Suwon. Interestingly, I've completed my education from elementary to high school in Suwon as well. Surprisingly, I continue my studies even in university here. Quite astonishing, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
My areas of interest include security, generative artificial intelligence, and Ambient AI. As an undergraduate, I'm striving to explore various fields.
</p>

<p>
I'm presently studying Software Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University. If you'd like to get in touch, please use the email provided below! Thank you!
